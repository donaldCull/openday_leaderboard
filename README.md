======

This leaderboard was designed to be quick and easy to use leaderboard/scoring system to be used in conjunction with the HTC Vive.  The leaderboard is currently only a client-side website that doesn't store any values in a database (Future work).

* The leaderboard was hosted on [Webhost 000](https://www.000webhost.com/ "Webhost000 homepage")
* The Domain name was registered on [Freenom](http://www.freenom.com/ "Freenom Homepage")

You need to point Webhost000 nameservers at the domain you have created on FreeNom.  The nameserver addresses can be found in Webhost000 general information in the members area.
These addresses need to replace your Domains default nameservers this can be done by changing nameserver option to custom.
